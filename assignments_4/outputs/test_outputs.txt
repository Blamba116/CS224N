You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, read in America.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that goes into one place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of circle I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When he <unk> up to bleed every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
It was done by <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- he found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations who fought against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never got to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> <unk> and I'd like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we get rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I talked to you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this today.
It also needs -- needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and all interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly be <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I'm going to get them around <unk> water <unk> almost 60 feet and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> of snow on another <unk> of snow after year.
The <unk> are born when we fall from the glaciers or break the ice <unk>
Each iceberg have its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to join and hold up to the end, whereas others can't <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, looking at a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts a iceberg releases rich on minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up and photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are just like that and will never exist in that way again.
It's not death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the life cycle.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to witness an B15 iceberg here.
Here you go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg from Greenland, in average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of her personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk>
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception. I won't pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and of the sperm joins the X X of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joins the X X of the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll come back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my activity to play two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how have you considered <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I do in my job is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> with people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical physics doesn't fit into male male <unk> and conventional women.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that won't be <unk> in the individual or male forms or female.
For instance, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which <unk> <unk> gene says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual has <unk> <unk> the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is built on following a female course.
When you <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after doing tests you realize that instead of having ovaries, and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is you can think it's about a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women as I -- and I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his structure -- I think it's a typical woman most women as I am <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a little bit complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a kid and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th century chromosomes and the uterus <unk> <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was the age of 19, when he started having a lot of medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people in the 20th century develop what is known as <unk> that is <unk> <unk> wrapped up in <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason why kids with this kind of bodies do that are <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to save them from a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people within one body.
The highest recent case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What a test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to reporters that there is not such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we get to the science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- that we thought were a stable categories of <unk> categories -- directly with <unk> categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What did we <unk> the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories.
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles in the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose and if it moved still not the <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract the living organs of a body and put it in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be <unk> someone like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> I'm making people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
So we assume these categories are much more fragile than we thought of me.
It <unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and bold and so <unk> in what they did, that I find myself every little bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power was coming to the political power by the blood right passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents -- they rejected that idea, and they replaced it for a new concept, and that was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences. That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
The democracy was <unk> democracy and at the same time we would get science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> passed through a <unk> <unk> idea.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of Dylan, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future rights movement from <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that to a human.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years would be allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, the opposite.
For the only fact that Mary was born three months before Mary are attributed every rights three months before Henry <unk> the right to vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> for virtue of being considered now is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on his hand, doesn't have the same rights as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through both the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a weird position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man -- you don't have to have chromosome and you have to marry a woman you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practical practice they don't do tests by <unk>
But this is also very strange as given the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I am not sure that we should be <unk> on this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> which probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than 40 to know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current current thinking to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be <unk> unless they are willing to share a change of sex, in which case you are allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light <unk> twins and then pick it up and then pick it up his fame.
But when the phone asked her the reason was a very <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political <unk> instead of the <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, I want to say that I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think of how it would be democracy, or as I might have been, if we had given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit a little bit about a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if you have people thinking about group.
And since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> stereotypes -- so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, most of me has something like something <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the feminine brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the Parents were really excited to find the way to protect people from part of the state, it is possible to have put more <unk> into this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body -- in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a much more perfect, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family to think about where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than the cost of construction.
So easily we could <unk> the world, perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just replaced by buildings of <unk>
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were owners and to the other half still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that around them have rules to avoid the pains and the construction unit.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a whole apartment building again, and when the rules of that <unk> place to build up the construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are <unk> new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> country by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
Over the next few presidential elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which I promise reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that they say you can't go and annoy every current residents of apartments.
We spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They named me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December <unk> we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, land that in some cases, worth of thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that <unk> there and a choice so that people can choose or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> to me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to progress.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that he built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for her talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily have a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the <unk> in the society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
February 17 was passed over again on another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of the 21st of February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> was at the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea in Korea is larger than the Boston <unk>
All you see there was built in four years, after it was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical. This is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and then to allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the end of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and dominant cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to go into the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that we'd like to change it immediately.
There are a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family and get a job, and sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy their clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about <unk> so that families can choose between several cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank TED work.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's in the inside, I'm going to make a confession to make a public confession and I live with the <unk>
I love to find and more recently, photographing and post that in my blog and colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> And what I look like is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I will love color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought them seven <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since you don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the life lessons that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
This is what I call brilliant tiger tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see OK.
You almost can see at least 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you ask yourself from the right people -- not just you <unk> you also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child coming in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remind them to be seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're doing well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see yourself with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't see you <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal <unk> and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week by just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to emotionally <unk> to these things, because the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and it after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For instance, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicist <unk> we need quite a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put us to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As intuition that you may have developed with the next step of the years is the one that says one thing can be in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet you play that play with that parking bar taught me a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my way down to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I set up to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then we do a pretty big approach to the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little piece of metal, a way of springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip with a new silicon chip -- and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> swimming under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of things, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want you to do it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> are not only people, but it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to <unk> the quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put out the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then it took it to a temperature of less degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was <unk> and the way I <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that you don't <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean is that a <unk> thing, and you don't get <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal is still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, watch this, the difference on the scale between one single atom and that little piece of metal is about the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you think <unk>
I mean, it's my kind of logical part that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you acting your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics is meant that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so.
Many negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did that.
I think my own story is just explains in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team together, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show you a demo to tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the gallery gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and, <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They are inside that you want to go to the end of the hall, too.
Let's go forward. That was <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured on what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million <unk>
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you actually get with 10 billion pixels.
It can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I began to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this seems to <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that children were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hit a <unk> on a Tuesday school.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they were doing it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get you even deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to push the image, so you can actually see what it is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best one is coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just ran around <unk>
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery.
You can write things, send your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they don't even come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment to do justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is, you have did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a flying bubble.
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there's something very interesting that has happened.
It makes some time, if you wanted to win a career. One, you would take a budget, and we would take it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what we have in engineering, and this is <unk> real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now the interesting thing is that real-time control systems are beginning to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities are a big thing.
As aside as I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet on the planet but represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms they become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing all the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
It's almost like the old <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it in Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> a <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> What don't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the experience?
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end, the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the sooner there are people around here and doing <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a fast call and goes to the toilet.
Second time, End of time.
First of all, a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, Yes!
That night everybody went to <unk> to the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody lower the world.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and consume them.
Today we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
And so on this project, we developed a few small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
So I went from <unk>
after a week.
And with this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of need.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> it wasn't anywhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still goes on there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part of the first part that we talked about in the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and said that Spain and the south of Europe, have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology work, new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- it was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a water <unk> with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels in them, you can write on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And by <unk> the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we <unk> a commission to design the entry of the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no gates or no windows -- but when you come up with it opens up so you can go through.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the roof.
Or you can close the building, and the whole architecture is lost, like in this case.
And those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when you get the roof, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see people <unk> so it goes on inside.
And here I'm trying to not <unk> the test sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids from <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to let you go, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to not getting wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of the <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and that each had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, right?
It's a flexible kind of screen like this with a normal configuration, in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears to appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be able to have a cloud of pixels in the 3D one that you can reach out and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers of today, the star from New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the catch in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go through all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> nursery like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could do all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign <unk> we can move from the digital world, the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But it can be in order to address the challenges of today: thinking about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, which is made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud of the <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered up.
You can move around with different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will be to share the main moments of the 2012 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's a lot of the physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a very high part of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you want to be in a better way, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe to themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they <unk>
What do you want to, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would I choose creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> I probably owe it to the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most people, and that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution to consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or <unk>
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one side is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic <unk> machinery is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the <unk> the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> asked them from the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to do without the effort of their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with a occasional <unk> <unk> <unk>
But therefore, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what is the future?
We are in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms come together, things start to change.
He goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess to me that when I was college a college student thought, well, <unk> <unk> death seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year I was born, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits their door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, you find a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It is <unk> George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
He was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted them to make us healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going through the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the bigger or the louder or faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best <unk> creatures.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, in the first place, we've known a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much, that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we need to happen.
A second possibility is to produce an evolution of the traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a sort of <unk> distant planets are going to exist, isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, an alternative possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first of you consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to be the individual and familiar level.
Think of that if you could be able to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body making the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes on your genes?
If you look at the future that kind of changes will become more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year to be finished, in 2004, I could get the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost close to the 20,000 and a week.
We don't really <unk> a lot to get the human genome to the fact that the human genome is going to be increasingly <unk>
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves as they are going to have <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine, in the cells of a <unk> plants.
Can you imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's true today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two small <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology takes that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases that will also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to happen, this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a 100,000 years and we can <unk> it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to have selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For bad or worse, and before what could be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall as you are at <unk>
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to with the flight <unk>
So immediately they looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the <unk>
You get the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then they said three words ...
The three most <unk> words that have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in your eyes.
Life was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that, I got a phrase, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that purpose, that's really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not quite a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I'm feeling the time that I think about things that didn't matter with people who know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental watch goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it's not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a <unk> performance -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all of all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle of not to die that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back to live differently.
You are flying around today, the challenge to imagine that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be like that -- but how do you get it?
What is it that you <unk> they still hope to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relations and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that we <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her home after he went through and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
Today <unk> has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation design and so that graffiti is kind of intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
That's why we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me."
And I said to him, "A second, isn't that <unk> you see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable, for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're making <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to give you a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea of how I was going to <unk>
He <unk> me with his brother and her father there at the very moment, he said, "All right, this is the <unk> <unk> going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw on that and record space negative.
So you go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual <unk> then with bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so the trip.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of an organization and so much move the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance companies and we managed to get a machine so that you could have a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and when they were born, they would have taken away the frames of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of cheap sun <unk> which we buy in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera that we <unk> we put it up on some LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and that's a <unk> -- we published the code <unk> software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There's no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming <unk> all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw his family in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I drew seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out of there so that I could get it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized it as one of the top 50 inventions -- and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that April of this year at the <unk> of the <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what you have in this room could be possible -- the <unk> the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in general situations often very difficult and at the same time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> areas.
And I spent 30 days eating this whole thing -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in <unk> situations with the only goal to try to explore social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that was seen entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got an <unk> <unk>
I shipped some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content I could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or her company when you do it.
But said that, it's a very good chance to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you about certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we look at the <unk> world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've got me in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something that was so difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that try to make <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> film is that everything from top to the end, he has <unk> <unk> all the time; from the <unk> which appears before the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we're going to be <unk> all the categories that we can in the film.
You might throw a shoe out, and you can get the more great shoe you have.
The most cool car you carry on in "The longest film ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the full process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> though, I don't know how much responsive people are going to be.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to be very <unk> but you know how it's going to be <unk>
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them, but it's certainly going to be worth getting a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of the film will look like a lot of idiots -- <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be difficult for the film to be <unk>
JK: Both of them.
MS: ... means you're not quite optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today of this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to have that new <unk> that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> mistake, and that mistake was this one.
In reality, no, there was no error.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was this image.
See, when you look for Google images in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were <unk>
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information -- especially in <unk> practices -- that the last line is probably the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to reality, something changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird <unk> that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> story.
We want you to take a story, but we want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father <unk> me in some lie in a lie -- and this is he looking at the way he used to me, like, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take out of my <unk> I would have to take the <unk> and go to business myself.
So what I started to think of suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to business the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies, and others who make small movies -- independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big, big Hollywood movies say that the reason why their movies are so successful is due to the wild brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, like that.
That's the general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a little <unk>
<unk> the kind of smaller films that we <unk> are more a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, to remind people of people is the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> he's in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh more time? The better <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What are there in a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to talk to me about my firm.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray color, and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: the brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my firm.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Okay, <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a <unk> Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and your feelings and your feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case that came up and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next day is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what does that mean?
What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important, <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your friend, <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness in all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very well involved together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies just <unk> in one of their strong dots or the other instead of focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them a positive thing for you, and it's kind of nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can see also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and <unk> <unk> those things that have gone and come out, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If somebody asks you to take your identity <unk> your personality personality -- what would it be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful being playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You're sure, stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because there were no control, they had no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how now they use MRI to identify the centers of desire to identify the centers of desire as much for film marketing as well.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden in the <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going to run in schools with high problems in the United States.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones I've ever been successful in the ones I've been dealing with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat you directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did you gone? Did it succeed?
Well, since the movie was sent into the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then, -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million dollars in the media for this film.
This covers only one period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no <unk>
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong with almost all the agencies that we talk to you to do to their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to the failure.
I think when you train your employees at the risk of <unk> it's getting their entire company to be able to be <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, forward, I think we need to give to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we need to harbor transparency.
Now more than ever a bit of honesty today, it's going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, to be applied to my attendance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Your biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are real-time control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with a <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> enter the gray box, <unk> <unk> and nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they were very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking for the <unk> in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it's actually working on that place: it's actually working on that <unk>
If you don't, <unk> it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> we don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the <unk> code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all of the points to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know it.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty old language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant from <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants.
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that small part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious way to go <unk> to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started doing scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 pieces called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So it wasn't like this.
The results have been to be from a number of weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> they would describe one and same thing, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets are <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really <unk> me.
There's the gray box -- and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the stock values of sensors for example, of pressure sensors and the vibration sensors, which is still running during the attack, with false <unk>
And believe it or not, this false memory data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk> <unk>
It's cool. <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the great steam steam goes on, you must open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator here.
That's where we need digital security.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And you don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
Let's think about it as possible.
And if you do that, with what we <unk> is with a mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are <unk>
We have to deal with the implications, and the better we start to prepare for them now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, so you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in the other way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry out and give you <unk> abilities or a other thing to do with wheelchair users get up and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are nothing different from something that you put in the morning, you give one big force, which is also increase your speed, and help you for example, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a <unk> payload and it is <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, to 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds of <unk> for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I <unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to users users of <unk> about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the wheels of <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talked about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the backbone that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talked about the population that gets quickly quickly <unk>
Her only option, many times -- by a brain injury, or any other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result couldn't walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the board, here on the back.
There's a little bit of batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
I was about 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing at the bottom of the air, on <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all the movement from propelled down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, "You will never go again.
That happened 19 years ago.
I stole it to the last little bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology, since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the users of chairs they were <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet her cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their living living relatives close with the <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But sadly, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario that has been <unk> by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation do you can't fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter -- hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the ape <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
As humans, as humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to set together and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of <unk> diversity of connections.
And when you see the Bonobo game, you see the roots of the root of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual and <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common both in bonobos as in humans.
And this is really interesting because <unk> this is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk>
I think, like her, sometimes we played the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's the playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we formed are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult with bigger creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take it to the peak of our capacity to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play play, you can be the most <unk>
So <unk> primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the fire <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers dominated a highly skilled staff have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a race standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has definitely gone through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  He got first to the captain and he asked her to go and save the dog from the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live in only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> <unk> that at that height or less had to turn off the fire and went into the fourth one for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We got out of the house the treasures for your home owner where, as they would expect, their trove of trove of attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the <unk> owner of the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at on top of what was someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling to Robin <unk> like in my calling as volunteer fireman is witness of generosity and kindness at a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have made it, or they are by doing remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
Be mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained to <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules of the fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit used in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called brick of assembly itself.
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> aesthetic <unk> about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the particular block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits -- a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> The transistor was just for experts.
I don't personally think the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
About eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and sound and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they're linked together.
So you can't get it in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can begin to make higher circuits.
A blue one with one green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse module that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures, very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower, just <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to become <unk> <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything needs to be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light turn on night, or why the door to an elevator is kept open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>    A few weeks ago, we took the designers at the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no expertise in engineering, just in cardboard, and wood and said, Do you get something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I think I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> <unk> for <unk>
Some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World <unk> we send them the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in Boston.
Here it comes up with a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody has to clean up when it's caught by snow because he knows it's not really good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to asking for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of the last year.
Did you realize that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else, that citizens <unk> with shovels on sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a mathematical component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 <unk> <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other <unk> government technology.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible system of <unk> City, when you see this app that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk> of <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people were stealing the batteries.
That's why citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology to know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they were told by the normal channels that would have taken for at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the power of California that the time has cost 2,000 billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning about the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as a lot of people think that it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk> form.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as an issue of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we have lost in view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they get crazy, the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> What we do together because you don't just <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> policy is not <unk>
And because the ultimately ultimately made out of us -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way we think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick up people for <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly a matter of <unk>
This is the heart of care and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the base of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of your house, and put some good music and see if you <unk>
And so it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a mobile and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the United States of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually actually comes up this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration, distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological definition.
I'm talking about a platform so that people are <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key <unk>
connected to two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but they think you're the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is a <unk> <unk>
So below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But that's what holds that holds into us that we have that we have to engineer as something that is operating with us, that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy that we have to make it <unk>
Because that's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we will get to where we need to go without fixing the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't escape government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of the way that it can be expanded <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I am a bigger generation than a lot of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions in any <unk> time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care about how to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They add hands to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up an <unk> out of <unk> by dumping a garbage <unk> that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't <unk> the citizenship.
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a swarm of voices, or also a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and the death corridor of death.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there are a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've ever noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here is impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American house in the <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough -- it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all of the discussion in the family.
She <unk> lots of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and her experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was a little thing, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good guy.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would go back again and if I told him yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So he looked at her and smiling and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went across the room, and he got up, and he said, "Come on. We'll be two to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget that.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know -- I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget that.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought it and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the <unk> <unk> I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14, or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package and I did not know where the <unk> took us my sister and myself and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> <unk>
He took a <unk> of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you're always doing the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother stares at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I got the look with the force and <unk> "Oh, you won't be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that they are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make any sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother's grandmother believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My <unk> died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to which, as it were, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> urban <unk> Los Angeles, Los <unk> Washington, Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all the young ones are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results of the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work for some curious.
In my state, as well as other states, as well as other states, you care about the rights if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where it was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility of getting out of it.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense, you've got to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crimes of <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death <unk>
An <unk> rate -- an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you would not allow ever to fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk to you about slavery today.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what they defined their lives.
Now there are people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell me, <unk> Stevenson, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, says, <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we go through with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
We have trouble talking to me, I think that's because we're not willing to engage in a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way to our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we would be able to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we <unk> in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very hard issues, the positive things are, though, and yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual nature.
With creativity -- development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas as well as <unk>
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, counseling for spirit, a will for being in despair and be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you about <unk> that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we <unk> these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, and I had a very young lawyer from knowing Rosa <unk>
These women would get together just to talk.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to get to talk to talk.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. Yes <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> me telling me that this idea of justice is <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death <unk>
We try to reduce the population in the prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that point, Ms. <unk> <unk> he got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be too but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for each other.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every single one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves for our technology, because of our designs, not by our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not in the way they treat rich and powerful rich, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients 13 and 14 years old, that have been <unk> to be <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn somebody into what is not it?
Justice as an adult, but I see a kid.
And one night I was <unk> <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 <unk> <unk> a little, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14 black customer is treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there had been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics there.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I wasn't just <unk> but I had sent the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid case.
I went into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man when I met a <unk> black man.
When he saw me, he came to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "I'm <unk>
And so I approached it and <unk> me.
And I <unk> into the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you that that was <unk>
It connected deeply with me, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity to <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk>
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the guy who had written those <unk>
They got the policemen <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly I don't know how, the room was full of people, and every day, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I reached the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked out the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking down here and for there.
Finally, this old black man with concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black age.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who would keep her view in the objective of <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is bound to each other.
What our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your case, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities near that.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be doing an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars of death penalty in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide in homicide in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be applied to the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is it?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain, to steal a bicycle, by stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
I think our current philosophy of punishment is nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting so much more data than the brain probably can <unk>
And as nothing makes us care more than survive, the first stop standing of all of that data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information in the environment that could be damage.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the bad.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, it's very true.
And because all of the digital digital digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder is <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going from bad in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, though, what happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the growth of species, the shortage of water and <unk> without <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
The child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 years in the last 130 years.
We're really living at an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to <unk> higher and higher expectations for you.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> television, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So much of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> on the information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- at good and bad time, in the war and <unk> to recession, in <unk> and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop in front of any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends on <unk> call infinite computing sensors and networks, the robotic printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized biology, all over the planet, synthetic biology, the <unk> vaccines and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from <unk>
It was spade.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline that I had.
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops were covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate <unk> of aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is of aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came in, and he made something as cheap as we used it as it was <unk>
Let's take this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy control.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour, compared to 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have a lot of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after <unk> <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight through the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Will nanotechnology <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> is the size of a small fridge <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> <unk> water, <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The Coke President of Coca-Cola just said to make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which we are -- Coca-Cola is that Coca-Cola is a <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And of having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
So better than that, and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, technology <unk> <unk> and they lose the market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to reach out when it shows your health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the <unk> X <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can address these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can get blood <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnoses that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that you don't want to call the food <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds ever before we get to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you <unk> What <unk>
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of <unk> dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
How about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and they can act for the first time?
What are these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that teams guided by their passion with a goal, of course, they can do things -- things that could only do the great corporations and the governments.
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the recognition of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the major challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades extraordinary remarkable.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of departure.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that's nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what's going on here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, it's a few mangroves.
There were <unk> of about 20 degrees, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was getting more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the <unk>
They <unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing is changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well -- well, I started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, called <unk>
I went fishing in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture there was something <unk>
<unk> I mean, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are on the background.
And most fish are blobs of tiny spots on some <unk> remains of coral <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Don't <unk> the <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a living alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> it because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what the fishermen are -- every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
It <unk> the starting point to start -- a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like that.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, and the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and to extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the amount of changes.
And at the end to keep some <unk> the remains.
And that, in a large way, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when local societies, kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this doesn't look like a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a <unk> sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them are presented with such a captain such as a captain such a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the huge role that it can be delivered a protected marine area.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the West, for example?
I think the arts and cinema may maybe fill in a vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you might have noticed that the nuances and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were really touched by the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do we have <unk>
Because it raises something that it has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger than me, it seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, it copper in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only one small percentage gets viral gets countless views, and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things creators and <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the last summer.
<unk> I was not supposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would take to the <unk>
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday on a Friday. You have to start on on a Friday.   You all want me to come up at the end of a week, the weekend.           <unk> <unk> <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> soap. It's one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk>
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view, and they share with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment difference of the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation, with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a <unk> version that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity I woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then the international <unk>
Suddenly it came up with a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be able to form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written to be <unk> this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video per minute, just the truly unexpected and unexpected thing can be <unk> so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit, I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that are <unk> circular by the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and their humor, Casey <unk> made that five million saw and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new things that we do in a way.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> and creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, hardly the current media today, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life was supported by the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not going to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that the story was <unk> but I was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been devoted to a <unk> task to escape her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat is expensive to the sea dressed of <unk> ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> we would take it first and we would take you my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> <unk> on each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he was <unk> I end up on the trip was too much to it; and the first apple I tried, I was given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations and shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants from immigrants in.
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class, the existence of <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in an assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't matter what he was like, which was generally <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform and <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home."
home, where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop and then studied to be <unk> and she opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> boys and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
They were <unk>
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student with what I <unk> of myself.
In the other, it was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But a lot of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer picked me picked up the young Australian girl in the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its <unk> <unk>
As <unk> resident <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence she would never have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get into the ship.
Not ever had an option.
<unk> said to me, "and you're not what you don't <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I knew, the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of it.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career.
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time as well as being a stranger, a <unk> new thing in the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, <unk> optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and courage.
So I kept my intuition.
I went to a small group of people who <unk> <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
<unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move it to the United States.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and <unk>
Before we end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in an age where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to.
Life didn't change for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
<unk> became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
With no support of her husband, he caused an <unk> to <unk> and to take the cause of it, and it was much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't make it completely wrong.
He was in the shower in the room in the <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I watched it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand <unk> and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve to our family, that runs through women.
Since that we were and how life <unk> we now can see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, <unk> brave at each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> here in the fourth or fifth line.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with aircraft.
At that time, when you <unk> the great prince <unk> he was <unk> I was taking a bow and a <unk> to the soil, he was able to get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we came out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was really excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I gave myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have a camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
I felt like the technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
When my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it out of it.
<unk> our inspiration.
So I <unk> I threw myself into this technological world to see how to use it to make magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
I put the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do for what does it do for us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  says, "This box is <unk> <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character of the book.
So at a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes run to me.
My little girl inside all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always becoming a <unk>
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what I <unk> in the book.
Another idea I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy books, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Russia for millennia, in an old <unk> <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that is about today as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out abroad, take the camera or the iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do it.
So in order to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, I would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a collection of a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
And inside of the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book, you have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video it goes and through augmented reality, you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves the screen.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology and the technology approach one to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves into the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think -- that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, since we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's a very simple thing.
He's got a <unk> and it has <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I was able to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when you need <unk> or a urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before I go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light <unk>
That's the best thing it can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their houses, taking their blood pressure, <unk> to their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to regain the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the cost of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but it's also using <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with you with a video.
We all have <unk> controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATM <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food supply chain.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> where, and when it's open, you already open up in the office and others are shut down.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as a <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we would want to be <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that you will help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> or <unk> for instance, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my former passion before I draw it, but it was a little bit different because of using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I'll start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk> road <unk>
But he has a <unk>
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like dark and colorful and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with some idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it sound <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Show the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that doesn't seem to be <unk> as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic I think they're those in which we don't even overestimate things around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs that's very important to <unk> because otherwise something look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to be able to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures should have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken in the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of the different images with a perfect future.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place to find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to be able to find out the various locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the house of the top of the island for it to look more <unk>
So in order to achieve a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
And then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job by taking the pictures the result the outcome can be very beautiful and at the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start by showing you a little bit about technology, very boring.
Please do if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, it's kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we have technology <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a regular curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any of the technology that I want to do -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you <unk> for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If <unk> technology is as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years orders orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- looking at these <unk> curves.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
You get one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical <unk> I know like this until it comes up something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I try to ask, is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
Where new state is <unk>
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, over my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to be that <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer and computer and computer and computer and <unk>
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale in which I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back about two and two and two billion years when the Earth was a huge sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that these chemicals <unk> we give us a sense of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was floating out of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops out of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring materials from the outside and so the <unk> grew up grew from the outside.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because every one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> they <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time of adding chemical chemicals built, they grew more, <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was a very simple life, but things are interesting to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of the <unk>
And somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned how to save information, which was the recipe from the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we <unk> in this Darwinian evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> we can just write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust that I try to hide in security security <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and we would give it 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have it taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step of it.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step occurred in which things got very different and was that these cells started to swap and communicate information to be able to communicate with these cells.
I don't know if you know, the bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are so many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to place that they would be involved in communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a set of <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection occurred when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community together in a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together like one single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not using without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and established more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not more than processing information <unk>
It's the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those microbial cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the evolutionary period of time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit because he knew the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that we would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built into those information structures that was incredibly far away from the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting there emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds a certain analogy to mine.
But we took something very complicated that we made it in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
We now move through similar periods of organisms to <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape, the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and capable of evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that told you to take a billion years out of one billion years.
The next stage the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The <unk> language, and so they took less than a million years.
And the <unk> as electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer <unk>
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that you could not could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these <unk> <unk> <unk> running all these programs, and take those things that are closer to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order for numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequence of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that make the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now I think that the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of both of these programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs that have programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
And we took a few of the mutations to it.
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are <unk> absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They're dark gray programs.
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know -- I have the security that the goal can be done, because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and she pulls out a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> the plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand from all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use these programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment, when you become <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of coming out, the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300, of a <unk> that we have 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the first base, it doesn't come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how they call a <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what you call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the United States of <unk> in running more 400 <unk> in a regular season in a regular season in the <unk>
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you're <unk> to a surgeon that has a record for 400 <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a loved self has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family physician is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's a little bit about this year.
And the hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think should be the average of <unk> of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I was included with the mandate <unk>
That never, ever made a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Goldman
Really which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the nurses at General <unk> Hospital not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> right?
And even the <unk> of the <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with <unk>
And the <unk> of medicine with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then it would know everything, or as possible as it was close to the everything, because I love the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist to a cardiologist I was going to be going to that patient.
They report the chief <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there is a hard time to breathe.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read it.
He gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
He gave him <unk> water pills so that he could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
I sent her home to her home without talking to the chief <unk>
I didn't get the phone and did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that was constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By the send to her house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner way, which said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so unsure that he asked the nurse to <unk> the <unk> lady who is okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he wrote the high school and the ambulance together with the <unk> they brought them home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home, and I did something I don't normally do normally, at that time.
I went through the emergency service to home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was <unk> from Mrs. <unk> earlier, but another three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other people are afraid too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
"It remembers the patient sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
So she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same word of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and the <unk>
After an hour of having come to her house, after I gave her high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance <unk> had a blood pressure from 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days after the next two days, it was obvious that they never <unk>
It had a <unk> <unk> damage.
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, they would be transferred to what was happening.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks I'd come up with it, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make the peace and never more make that mistake.
Is that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very wrong inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the things and made sure that I don't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little about that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if you <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, I would be afraid of those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was myself in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man in 25 years with a pain in his throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin, he sent him home.
But as he was heading to the door he was following on his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my chief asked to talk to me to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can put it on Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but from the top, it can cause the close of those tracks.
He, luckily, not <unk>
It was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk> for the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same shift in the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculus thing.
So we had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out to normal. A colleague who was checking the patient perceived some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read her liquid command to him, and I asked my colleague to <unk> him.
He checked and looking at some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on, and they recovered well.
But every single case <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't come and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I be able to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for them to do not make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after anyone.
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll never hear somebody talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I would have a hard time in looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who make mistakes and not the ones that you can't sleep, and the ones that I know have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, which is the antibodies you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we do not of medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about <unk> and medical journalism, I have done a personal study of bad <unk> medical medical and errors to learn what possible, from the first article I wrote to the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, white, <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections.
In this country, they die <unk> <unk> for <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going down every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, and it comes to alcohol -- and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
So all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, we <unk> and we eliminate all of the professionals as a mistake, well, not anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art.
And his students were <unk> <unk> -- head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And he starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human <unk> you know, they accept it, and it won't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It would give the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I feel a lot of effort to convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember that.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a long time ago, in a week to a group of presidents of businesses.
Now, researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> for these executives and the time they are going to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
<unk> every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you have the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and of some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In the other way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive positive -- please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, I <unk> this very <unk> supermarket, which was at least in that time was very sophisticated at the time.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent of <unk> and this was when we were taking water from it.
I loved going to that shop, but I was asking myself, why I never buy anything?
This is the shelf of the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of <unk> that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of different classes.
I put a post to <unk> right at the entrance store.
We put out there from six <unk> or out of the 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop trying to test it.
More people stopped when I had <unk> 60 percent, that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What stopped when there was <unk> only three percent just came to buy <unk>
What stood when there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less good to conserve <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in <unk>
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, saving financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we saw the decisions about savings for retirement about a million Americans, from the next million Americans, from over 650 plans for this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funding funds in savings plans.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the number of <unk> <unk> were less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, the more people are <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize traditional financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three negative consequences by getting more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing to do is you make the decision that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively a better way.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that gigantic array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so that we can contrast and to contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less than today, which is less
People are always bothered when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're looking at is what we're seeing more and more is that if you decides to cut, get rid of odd choices, there will be a <unk> increase in <unk> <unk> costs, there'll be a better experience in the choice.
When I was <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that fewer <unk> got increased <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and low costs.
You know that <unk> in average are 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to handle the choices is the David David <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a insurance background.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on a holiday on a holiday on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to go, and then I want you to give a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second, but I can tell you what they thought was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique of the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use credit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we <unk> exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we add was that we requested the staff to think of the positive things that we would have in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of the 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For instance, this is a study we did in a head of magazines.
We saw that in <unk> <unk> the way in the corridor of <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> scheme is completely useless.
<unk> need to tell you something to do not the <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity <unk>
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision.
This is a car German manufacturer that allows you to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, and you have to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to be <unk> options, 56 colors, many choices.
And what am I going to do?
How much is.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and more.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they keep there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that information is presented with information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although you pick the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> in all ways you can make you choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> to eliminate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced you to have been designed to help drive <unk> or better, to use them in their business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years in Eastern Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that was writing to the government.
I had to register a sheet of text from written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of the texts.
If they found a script with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we did not think that somebody could do this, how much that would be <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints one page, that page will end up having a few <unk> red dots on every page that they follow a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That's what's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on its <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media using illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a computer computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us to be the victim of a crime than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from wrong in worse.
In the future, most online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> relative today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that the moves, to motivate us the protests, they motivate them the views, they motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a huge piece of research on the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national United States of governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall due to a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people in the attack on <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a <unk> of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except to <unk> a foreign authority.
<unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters in April Egyptian secret police in April 2011 and during the building <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder had notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to <unk> the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Nigerian government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give you tools to governments to <unk> to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond this.
It <unk> the Internet connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all media, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument don't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right thing that we're going to spend today, it's going to be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in North Nairobi don't have <unk> in the upper part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate in the park.
And predators, like the lions lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the one that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it.
So I grew up very much at lions.
<unk> are warriors who protect our community and livestock and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there's so few in the National Park, Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for their father's livestock and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were scared.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because even helped the lions see the pen in the distance.
I don't <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came on the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that we will light up and turn the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load your battery and battery battery -- electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> give out, because that's where the lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking down the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the house houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and he asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them. You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators like Jackson <unk> and it's also being used to get rid of their farms.
So thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes and I told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when you were <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like anything.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented electrical <unk> but I want to make my own.
CA: So I read that once, right, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it in every step in every step to my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come all the time by studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all of my life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When you get this, five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of the past two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we are ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms looking at her face by her mother, without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine ever <unk> North Korea to North Korea.
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also made more and more <unk> the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because North refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear of my identity that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually actually actually when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> one official told the other, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum in <unk>
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the 1950s, <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans did not have so lucky.
Every year countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky in <unk> many other North Koreans have not had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to engineer going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much higher challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even by a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride with pride as well.
Although I went to South Korea in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money sent to my family, and as <unk> my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border to North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a police officer.
He asked everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and locked across the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the <unk> points in my life.
I did everything for free my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison distance from South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office, and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
So at that moment, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that an unknown would mind ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the <unk> people.
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the <unk> <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language, practical language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family contact, we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Carolina, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you are going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> across the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South The South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles as though this is really wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert -- Los Angeles <unk> home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring people more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, what would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home you see the <unk> effects, that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold like cars.
I see centers of <unk> <unk> as Starbucks as Starbucks as Starbucks <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I got tired of me to drive 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my home.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, he belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what come in my own, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green. We put us together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid group of gardeners of the <unk> of all of the entire city and completely voluntary city, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city is <unk> up and in short <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I would say, "Come on, right?
A <unk> for planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it?"
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green Green members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It's 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough room to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it don't look like this?
<unk> a plant, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up in there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to <unk> my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Like an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can do.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how to affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
And I remember one occasion that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my yard, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassed by looking at people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to rob your <unk>
I mean, I am not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
These are these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was given their stories about how this had affected and how used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and was great to see how this was changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, working and <unk> all of them in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind for what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that they are stuck in, and I see guys of color that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may have the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now here's one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't <unk>
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious about what sustainability is, you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to try to work with people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
The <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you won't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, they come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  So you probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> highway <unk>
It's made out of pavement, and the asphalt is a good time to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt to <unk>
And especially if you go through your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, that far close to the cities, we want a quiet road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so that all of the rain water flow on the sides and they will have a road which is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet highway <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the rocks of the surface are out there.
First stone <unk> then several more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> okay, not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage hits this material.
It's a burglar asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive down the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool from steel, that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is you get the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big machine <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We did a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a <unk> test to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the <unk> and then of course, this road lasts several years without damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, which is bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, and you can even double the life of the surface -- to really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before you can show you how the repair acts of.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in her face that was unusual at the time, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made the girls in the school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide the books in the market bags for it to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, was to school and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became mastery.
This is it.
It returned two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> at risk.
For him, there was a higher risk to do not educate her kids.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember the moments that I was very frustrated about our life and he was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let them leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do that.
So you don't want to <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, and I have driving the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, which is a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice noticed that if she was still sending her daughter to school, I'd come back to try.
And so now, if he <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> <unk>
What I realize is Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and it sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school care about <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes didn't get too much, after the retirement of the United States.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, I see a future future, and a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I was <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back, <unk>
It's almost two years since we broke the revolution -- inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside of the country to call a day of rage and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women, and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the every of the regime, <unk> <unk> dignity and social justice.
You've shown a copy of the face by the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, until the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and some losses of about 50,000 dead people, we managed to release our country and <unk>
However, <unk> I let a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to share with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> a <unk> transition and just to democracy and national cosmology.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of <unk> and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women Women by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of women and by our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself in a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are <unk> of political policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
And yet, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of American ambassador, and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of murder officers from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> violations.
Our society, made up by a subtle mindset, and it's been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icon of the revolution.
I'm not here today to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I am here today to tell you that we, as a nation -- we chose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the election didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought brought and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why our society is still <unk> and dominated with selfish policy policies and <unk> both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> <unk> representation of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and quantitative <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also to put in practical practice -- rather than <unk> in the <unk> of the competition, the inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, desperately desperately needs to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic, the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all people have <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all existence.
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> <unk>
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a reliable question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of the domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the ones that everybody else <unk> Why she is left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no teaching in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I was just 22 at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first <unk> my first <unk> green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, the one I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where each year millions of women, and even some men.
It might be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at the University of Harvard and I have an MBA at Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies for <unk> <unk> and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married by 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the <unk> all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and <unk> and domestic abuse is only going on in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration or a long duration of the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> reason why, <unk> <unk> is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who <unk> it and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, your warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York subway and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a <unk> university and I worked on a very big bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and that looked like a <unk>
I had a big <unk> like apples, and a little <unk> <unk> and seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me: which was so hard, I had gone to Harvard, I would put a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And that's why the <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leave my job from my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a physical, financial <unk> financial psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where you come into the scene in the scene here.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where they're supposed to be so safe he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
And another thing he kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in small.
I needed them to feel sure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already serious about <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I got my mom's suit of my mother and married him.
Even though what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily living forever, because I loved him and he also wanted me to do that.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it was never more <unk>
I spent two times more in our <unk>
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey and <unk> out of traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is victim domestic violence at some point in their life, and the Disease Disease <unk> informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was picking up from me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everyone does is, why don't you just don't <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do, because we can tell the victims, we know something that normally you are, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence that happens after the victim has put in order to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, and <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, which are usually forced by judges to spend time without the man to <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why they're just not <unk>
I was able to <unk> because of the last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, I would have killed if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, the police, my neighbors and family friends and family, and I am here today because all of you. <unk> me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as a headlines, women -- women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people it's a way to say <unk> <unk> as if the <unk> victims were <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that they learned a lesson of what happened to you, and that <unk> their lives <unk> and happy lives like <unk> wives completely free of violence, like me.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I went marrying a kind of cute man, kind and kind of kind and you have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to ever go back to ever again, is ever a <unk> <unk> <unk> my head in the hands of someone who says he will.
At this moment, you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all of this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people that are listening to me right now, they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, to his sister, their best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love -- particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence just shedding light on it.
We don't need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future future.
It <unk> the <unk> signs of violence to intervene in order to slow down their <unk> and show the victims of safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call it Cameron Cameron and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have anything like this.  Luckily, I brought <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but I would find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
And these heels.
The worst part is to go through this sweater in your head, because it's when you're going to laugh about me, so you don't do anything while he covers me your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed anything that you thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he <unk> her back and <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, although <unk> and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my working sector -- that's to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do but <unk>
The first question is, how do it get to be model?
And I always say, A <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as our health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also we've been associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've been known to leverage for money.
And I know there are people in the public who are now shown <unk> and maybe some of them are <unk> and maybe some people who are <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when you grow up.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then what I would tell you to each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you will be the first.
If after this <unk> you still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American <unk> or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you have to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate to you all I learned in 10 years as a model -- because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> and a little job on your back, no matter what you think about, you know, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> <unk> of underwear for 10 years, people would look <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're getting into the personal domain, but it was a child.
So I was looking at my grandmother by a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you are not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light in red and, of course, we <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent so I could keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges <unk> because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and the last year of the teenagers who stood stood and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men and <unk>
And there are only <unk> black people and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times <unk> I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that from 53 percent of girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is life of a role model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give you an answer that maybe that's <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also wonderful to be able to work with creative people, clever and <unk>
And that's the way, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some thinner legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
You only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable at recognizing the power of the image of the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera -- but I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go and I didn't go and I wasn't <unk>
There was no directors of <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very small care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took tourists random.
My story begins when I was <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and <unk>
So what happened we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes next.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you get to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey of life.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a week of October, and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches a new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion all the year.
Recently, one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> of dolls that were <unk> in the previous <unk>
And I described to me what had felt to five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't get out of many of the family photos.
I am always the one you get the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't go back to somebody and ask him, you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, as a <unk> stupid <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They hardly are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World <unk> in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World World -- where we have 16 species of these 16, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why are they? First of all, they provide <unk> ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help to kill all the bacteria -- they help to absorb the anthrax that it would not be for them and cause large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are taken from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk>
<unk> was the <unk> symbol and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and under Egypt.
In <unk> Hindu <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they go very important to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall out of the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned to use vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on the <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a housing problem that's not going to do anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need of appreciating these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you tell them about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed because he saw it because he saw it <unk> no effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do -- and all I do <unk> my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all of that, everything we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a <unk> decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful <unk> and descends into the <unk> River and teach the local tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people weren't all interested in doing that, so that they were <unk> to come to work, and sometimes they didn't <unk>  We were amazed that the local in so fertile -- in so fertile -- we had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato <unk> in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
And I thought we only would do the Italians in Africa, mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, what they did, and then to see what the French did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
We will look at the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave them to <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in my face, <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can you -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided that 27 years to only answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never go to anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local -- who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never come to a community with an idea, and he sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years, and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, we would be <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what an opportunity has <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know this is because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one one, and we work on face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the medical doctor of the company, the medical doctor of business, which sets up with you in your house, in your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia, and I started this test.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> junk that we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest <unk> business of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the help and then <unk> will come into mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you have <unk> you have more this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, which we are not energy, not energy, <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together with this group of people, and I <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population gets growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> companies <unk> <unk> companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
One, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I later have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 companies of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
No word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars next to their dedicated dedicated dedicated to those who will do for you, what someone did by this gentleman who are talking about this <unk> somebody who tells you, what will you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> who looks at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those are around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How to share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cows for our communities so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> who give a shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most beautiful number of ocean properties.
I live near this home and I thought how could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and it was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this produced me a profound gratitude for the time.
He made it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up on the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends and transformed the wall of this home house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know how to wait for this experiment, but the day next to the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die of death, I want to be <unk>   "Before they die -- I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before they die, I want to sing for millions of <unk>
Before they die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before they die, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before they die, I want to hire you once more."
Before they die, I want to go to the <unk>
Before they die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> <unk> me and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways, and <unk> it is about helping the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center of civic center we did a kit and now have been made up in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of voluntary grassroots that is increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
<unk> is something we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we become more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces can be able to reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and with more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help us improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
I don't speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it -- it happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice about it: never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's a lot. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember whether I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we held when I was four years old, he was mentally pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed a new case of autism, and although it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world, there is no causes of known known.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new way to be in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure on the smallest things, like putting the cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was in the <unk>
As I was growing up, it would become more different, and the differences were made more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about <unk> communication and love, and I realize they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
The difference happens by the beauty that you give us differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is correct.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences you <unk> It's a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your interior and frankly, the search for normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me a communications teacher to give me a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds and their big books and the <unk>
But when you develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
<unk> I felt when I had these conversations with the students I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this a wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see your science is sexy and engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care about the <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make it <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as Einstein, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are kill, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but that is supporting too much in the area of our brain and we get <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a bit, and then give you graphs that we <unk> to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key keys that can help everyone else open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the <unk> English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that he defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks an audience to search for a public care -- no matter at the game or start, and that, when he wins, you get it on the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the base of politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the exact newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the famous name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
She got him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
I had all kinds of suggestions you could have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him a <unk> state of State and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even if they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of them, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the daily <unk> <unk> and always <unk> "Not this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King because he would give him to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> <unk> title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no sooner but it only meant <unk> that I had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who is really serious about a <unk> and insignificant degree as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky to continue there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that as a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to tell you is that the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Everything if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads in <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of unmanned air vehicles and so on.
Reality and story have <unk> <unk>
So I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern from the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the five nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end the Senate he won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually fundamentally changes much more words than what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and rocks with <unk> tools.
Like each other, I have a cheap flashlight of light <unk> held the head with this rubber <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches which hold the walls of that <unk> hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole to risk their lives without paying no reward, and often, dying.
I went home from that hole and went home, but they might never will. Because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is going to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not just a degree.
When we ended up talking to me, I was really sad, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He did a <unk> and her stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer me my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some people even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says there's more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans throughout the whole of the slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer is about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of the <unk> today.
However, today you can recognize entire families for generations to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to figure out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost every world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick <unk>
This strange, strange show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a <unk> temperature <unk> men, women, children, in fact, entire families <unk> on a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in his head, until 18 at the same time, and they take them out of <unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee breaks to eat, and not to drink, and the severe <unk> he did that pee was quite <unk>
As <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side, quickly grabbed me and said to me, <unk> Don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you directly.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for their release and he complained that he was <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> rocks for miles per mile on the way down to trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and children <unk> their heads on <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to do with what <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> completely their homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was fascinated by women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It was led to me on a <unk> <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know about craft, they're locals <unk>
They have small rooms, private, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each area is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From foot in the <unk> I remember a <unk> fear of <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what he should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There were no <unk> doors.
There were great enough windows to <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and because they played a hard issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens to us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 children and 300,000 children are sold every year as sexual <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the <unk>
This is a family toy.
<unk> hands are the father, the blue <unk> of blue and their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid down to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, to be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to have a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older <unk> some younger kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and forced them to work <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came to me -- I was <unk> which his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The <unk> branches of trees in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of her love is not going to flee and, like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to younger slaves under their seat.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they woke up the latest networks, but they had been working on the <unk>
At the cold evening and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a teammate <unk> with her bike.
They asked us to take it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then you signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took off the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour -- we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photographs on my head as you <unk> in these water to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of us, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer camp, and everybody was full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had sticking to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners <unk> in a pit in another part of Ghana.
When they were out of the pump were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his <unk> eyes because many had been underground.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy bags and then they will be <unk> to another area where they were <unk> the rock to be able to extract the gold.
To the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, on the side, we see a lot less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends like this <unk> victim and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When her father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
As he died, his uncle, <unk> invented the debt of the uncle as being a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the <unk> <unk> and the leg injury, you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said to be <unk>
On top of that, <unk> has T.B. and, nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams of being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote, <unk> which inspires me so much respect.
I want to throw the light on <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give you testimony to them, and we're going to do everything we can to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> These are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There isn't a day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope these images show a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire, and that that fire <unk> light over slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management camps.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high-level level of dexterity -- and probably some initial <unk> that can have a genetic component,
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a ballet dancer <unk>
In the last few years has made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know if there is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so you don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials are never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could be done on their exam <unk>
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is you sort of <unk> that you don't think about a try, you see, in a sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows somebody healthy while it emits sounds when we can figure out how to imagine a <unk> <unk> because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound, and we all have the genes that we need to produce the <unk> for example.
And as they did it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as we <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> also affecting the <unk>
On the plot of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole range of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the examinations are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to help address.
We can reduce the <unk> <unk>
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
With high-resolution monitoring we could get goals.
We could make mass recruitment for low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines accessible to some 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call under price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. Okay?
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not do it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data <unk> in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work now and now has shown that it works on the mobile grid as well, which is what we <unk> the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> gray.
We lie in the dark, in <unk> <unk> and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect -- we do the impossible -- possible and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11 March 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going to happen in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where I was <unk> there was the place in the working room as part of the response equipment.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 and <unk>
It's a little fishing <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns affected by the wave.
The amount of water that was recorded over 24 feet and over three miles a land in the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We got the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory of the local factory.
We <unk> us and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from the peoples around them to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean <unk> <unk> the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center was <unk>
And there were the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard about the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't going to happen to myself my horizons.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them over a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab about the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get very precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be as tragic as I have the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they became luckily, more photos, and they needed more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village town north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporal <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time you <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on course of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> it could be a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures were <unk> covered in bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, even with oil, and I continue to <unk> all of it together was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless it was clean <unk> and it was <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have a <unk> guide.
It's very easy to harm the photos even <unk>
As once he said, the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> her same one, but he stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
I had a <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the full picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something from their history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble, quite far from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
Day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little kids -- not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
She took a week to find his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her her little child was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past he would not have been shaped by the day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up and <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs, and the big <unk> -- most of them came back to their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of photos of <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over <unk> a thousand in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one of all, one person wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we would take to look for.
And this was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you go back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to some of them with something bigger, to bring something bigger, using their talent to something that are not thin skin models of perfect skin.
So to finish this email. I would like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a little picture of my family -- my grandmother and my mother, and my daughter just <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in every single few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in a sample of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create video motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-ray and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> you will create a <unk> photons of just a millimeter wide long.
And that package <unk> that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how do you spread out those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
So the pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we start to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the reflections of the top you see it in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the reflections would <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie -- of a slow bullet in motion.
And how about trying to be <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall of the <unk>
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> <unk>
But if you look at once more and more -- you'll notice that, as the light stands in the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato <unk> and the light bounces inside and it bounces back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if your fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo to the exposure, then it comes very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that <unk> package and millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and we took them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of that data in raw and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, other heroes.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door, and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point to it to the distance.
When you projecting a laser can be recording a <unk> picture that you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, we will all go and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our ritual.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's on the turn of the curve, around.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected out of open windows by looking at the open.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the insides of the body or <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of mapping health in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> He himself became science in art, a <unk> art art.
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
We create a new form of computing computing with slow and color code.
And let's look at those waves, remember, the time between each of those waves of those waves is just a few hundred second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these will go from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects. So Einstein would have happy to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes comes up in the camera.
They <unk> the corresponding of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against the humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, <unk> to <unk> and become famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all these people gathering that <unk> looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, <unk>
It's a lot of a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about me, from my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European <unk> every single Internet <unk> has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, I was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me -- all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a specific response, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We don't give you this information.
At the end, it would be a agreement.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly stuff on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and 5,000 <unk>
I watched it and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go back and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> in <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what <unk> they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said in the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And so not the fall of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today government agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to use it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not very much of fashion.
When you go home to your <unk> that just because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile mobile phones to remember you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> What's going on?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so we <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a blend of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C.
It's not <unk> You can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
Just for accidents, how I got at birth.
Now, I'm going to ask you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in the present one.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled
Let's go for a ride.
After Christmas, you're in the shopping mall, drive in circles for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty empty places for disabled
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. <unk> is just one of them.
There would be a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three hundred sisters were going to public school, my parents gave to the school system and <unk> that I was out there, and if I didn't take away all the ultimate note -- all of you had had my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another assumption, that I used was just hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten. I walked around like a car champion that I received many <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my hometown and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still being all of the family.  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think that the <unk> would think <unk> to the <unk> as a <unk>
The people I grew up there were not having trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so that <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we won't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
On the summer holidays I often was <unk> so I would drink milk milk and put me cups, warm cups on the back, <unk> me into the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we did yoga -- it was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in your head.
My parents -- this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination, and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> in the theater.
Everybody <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the maximum note in my lectures, and also in his class.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> I noticed a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end, we finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave him an actor without cerebral <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I grew home, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was an extra bit of an extra <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell at the realization that he was going at high speed of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver who had cerebral palsy,
I worked in <unk> across <unk> and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my mother brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> Arabs was much easier to fight the stigma of stigma <unk>
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I was about invited to the news program on cable <unk> with Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I was to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I gave it to the <unk> desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> knew they didn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never fall away from no child and older.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I <unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What <unk>
We really should be praying for her."
A <unk> suggested that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, however, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive <unk> that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee refugees -- a tiniest part of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I am doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it gets there, there are no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gives him a guy who offers him to <unk> it after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They presented to a young man.
They finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist age, and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a small town trying to pursue their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he came in.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of <unk> of well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't care about them, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of <unk> cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the youngsters are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I was forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor young leaders at a corporate top.
<unk> to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a graduate college college college college was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> transported to local residents who they normally couldn't afford to.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I believe that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
It teaches young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years ago, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers that were <unk>
For those who grew into the Civil War, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for identity, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now it's working in the creation of the world's first <unk> public park.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people can go together, and as he says, smell the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business <unk> it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in developing and put in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> That's how it calls it when it is that it is created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help rent and keep the <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to make young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was made out of the leaves as a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings in step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters, with <unk> <unk> balls of aluminum paper and <unk> balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and <unk> <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to get what they had <unk> who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was a little <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris, or in <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> tons of waste and <unk> tons of recyclable product every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked around her <unk> and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I <unk>
And we <unk> the mechanical mechanical <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and move around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also a form of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I think <unk> that <unk> are the most important workforce in the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the <unk> and effective form every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
<unk> we had controlled for decades and centuries and they start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have room for what the economy engines start to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average speed of an necessary.
With that I mean simply at the speed of that used to move in the contemporary time.
We are usually not <unk> and we don't slow down, and we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of the water <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that we would take away from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us safely leaves us from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always supposed to stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection collection on the street, grabbed my little child, and he dropped the stairs <unk> and he dropped the stairs <unk> and he went down and he was doing his <unk> journey as I did all <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> We work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have in account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor hand.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about trash, it is three percent of the amount of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic for this.
So on the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see to someone whose job is to clean the trash of you, take a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the Addis <unk> capital <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After looking at some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> with <unk> generates heat in the interior, so that you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And third, it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from several stories applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the location of the site, which is located in a lot of a lot of the city growth -- where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And also, there is two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries out of the building.
And this spreads with an <unk> <unk> which creates an open space in the building that is <unk> by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air <unk> and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we inspire us in these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry.
So we're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that will leave the air and light in a way through the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what they <unk>
But we all realized that this idea of the market was something to be much more profitable than the commercial center -- because at the end of the accounts there were more <unk>
And then the idea of the facade -- it was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to glass, but because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It's expected for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I am designed with, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I set special attention to <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen connected gates connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets -- creating 12 early blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points with the idea of interconnected <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last piece was thinking about the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local rules that set up a higher density at the upper levels and a lower density in the plant plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community occupied space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and do activities like running a race for two kilometers in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives are changing communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment and they have an objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had lots of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a while after the school out of school, he was a little late and I hid myself in the <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the table from my teacher from grades.
And then I did.
I <unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit of them.
All like that.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all out of <unk> and I just just like to be there, just to be there, no longer <unk>
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk> obvious it.
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little little girl, so small, it was so good at <unk>
Would the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause for <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would take a loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab to study the <unk> in all of its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there wasn't jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
I wouldn't have a <unk> King or <unk>
No Shakespeare.
I <unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> We <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as far as the jealousy, almost all of them.
This year was 100 years of his masterpiece, searching for the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> of mine, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard it is.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious like the jealousy, that are reduced to the person, their wish, to their <unk> are a well-known narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
By being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to sing the knife <unk> right?
<unk> do all of all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
All she makes for me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every genuine <unk> that detects in his lover -- he adds his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like big <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good the language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> <unk> listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then it <unk> those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's <unk> scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, the truth of the truth, really painful. In fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the tracks towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says he says, "A woman who makes us suffer, it causes us to make a lot of much more profound feelings and life than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's saying we're going to go looking for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk> so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird about that man, who didn't get <unk> on what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> really describe how the <unk> are doing to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me as I was eight years old -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman in Michigan was <unk> by 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook since I would send messages to <unk> <unk> for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new bride of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though <unk> is creativity, right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> books that treat how the <unk> <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy, the membrane <unk> what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take out of your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- it takes your <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk>
I can't give you <unk> everyone as much as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when you're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I always have a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> <unk> but <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once they <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could you still be so simple?
What if <unk> really is a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> from the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
<unk> <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July <unk> Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and descended on the Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest coltan in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon to reach NASA -- about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
<unk> gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
People died, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface, of which <unk> after Armstrong death, last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds.
Why <unk> The <unk> answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the most <unk> mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why will fly about the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the contemporaries, Apollo wasn't just a victory in the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to be able to do that.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle but in 1969, the <unk> <unk> flew to 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the Apollo <unk> 10, and the <unk> optimism about the power of technology has evaporated from the way that we imagine that the problem that we would solve is going to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seems to be <unk>
I remember the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't take the <unk> tube tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that <unk> happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They <unk> and enriched our lives.
But not the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak in their peak without worrying for risk, they preferred small investments that they could get out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is also not in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a immediately.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound ones.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is coming from sources of renewables like solar <unk> wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price they don't exist.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policy and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy policy of America, or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, they're not going to be.
We know over time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk> of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are really political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops harvest or systems for storage and <unk> in food, but there will be <unk> there will be <unk>
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The <unk> president was declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are a lot of cancer types, some <unk> to treatment, and only in the last 10 years appear to have been found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: the institutions should have to support the problem, should be really about a <unk> problem, and we should understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of the technology to solve big problems, does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like this to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decrease of trust, it's a very widespread belief for it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the trust.
I think the <unk> the target and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that could have increased on others.
I don't have that.
But I can use the opinion polls and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no amount of evidence.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were really trustworthy 20 years ago, they're still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway down.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the record of opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at are the generic attitudes that people feel when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
It's probably <unk> by asking, "What does it do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence we are going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or type of person, going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give to the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real confidence in real trust, because they try to address the good intellectual judgment in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's an stupid.
Isn't that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent objective in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about doing a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the commodities, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they aren't likely we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see you <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I haven't yet been <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do before trust.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to be judged.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, and patient officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task of judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the actual <unk> that I will actually go <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system is destined to guarantee <unk> and <unk> testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you have to be worthy of trust and <unk> to people who are safe and if they were trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions, the <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should be able to rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, in the end, is the signature because they kill us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to give <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, do the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I store my socks on me says I can <unk> without giving explanations differently.
And I take it back and return the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of confidence and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that frame, they can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> on the screen is its body physical <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is <unk>
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Sciences <unk> and I joined my <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
It took a transparent bombsight with deep cameras to pick up the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, coming into the three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or the words with the virtual touch sensor, that there's down every floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
Many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> I created this only physical bubble.
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in the space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and control the movement by a combination of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means human movements can <unk> and be able to reproduce and keep them in the physical world.
You can teach yourself physically and distance and the famous <unk> take Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physical reality physics that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us and not have to have we have to <unk> from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only threshold left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they create firmly that there was just an <unk> path towards <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an singer from Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends got me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
And so at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much greater to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided I decided to look at another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> Good <unk> is Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and much better than I <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I meet a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
You get a lot of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning this map seemed to me because this is what students in China learn.
I've never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map has a map of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way up to research -- such as comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked on research, why don't you do it also in life?
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are <unk> politics and spiritual.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of translation that I realized is that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like or <unk> never.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client in <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on my office from my office and he took off the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with the men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought me to the <unk> it made me easy to just move the head as I was doing the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later on, then you have children later, until death goes on.
For <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my squad <unk> encouraged me to press Alex talking about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys underneath his category, he <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And so my squad squad <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and I had real consequences, not only for Alex and their loving life, but for race families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> <unk> matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight percent of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that shape their life will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People are not trained to panic.
This audience will be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future mate to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final phase of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change yourself, now is the time to change itself.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility goes to the top to the 28, and things become complicated at <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear about is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
The journalists were <unk> names to the <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, all days, smart intelligent, interesting things like you or your kids and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not a good for me, but this relationship I'm not going to be <unk>
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better marks the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it's going to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game game play.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you going to start a career, choose a number, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and <unk> to do everything once to <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying cars sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want right now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of what it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said that I'd like to work in art or entertainment or entertainment, but I couldn't still decide, so that I spent the last few years working on how to <unk>
As it was cheaper to live with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> her previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she would wake up with her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his head and cried for almost the whole hour.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the <unk> <unk> was going.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who <unk> that crisis of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity capital -- I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know what this: capital identity generates identity capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that <unk> that they want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who <unk> jobs and I did it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> that you get together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who you know, what you know, how they talk, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with whom is almost always coming out of the outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what are called weak ties from their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs were never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when it has a couple and there his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is a better age to sit in your head than 20 or even 25 or I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live right now or <unk> you now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing that is going to work or kill time with anyone who is <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fourth <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum in the other state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which she was alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter that says, "Now the space of antennal contacts are not <unk>
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that come from the airport to come from Los Angeles, which goes somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea of <unk> spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
So I have the privilege of saying to <unk> <unk> as Emma every day: the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity capital, use their weak <unk> they choose your family.
Don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in <unk> <unk> for a job that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as a professor, I applied tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When I was working on, <unk> grades.
What struck me is that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and the worst students.
Some of those who had better performance had no better <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of things you need to learn in seventh grade, <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if we succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid way and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West Academy <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would take as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> professors working in neighborhoods really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking yourself, what about these vendors are going to maintain their <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a significant <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to her future, day after day, not only for a week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my determination out of determination and then waited for about a year more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly increased likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing <unk> even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we design <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are lots of talented individuals who just don't follow with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly related determination is not related or it is even related to the choices of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> of growth."
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University, by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
In Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk>
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy <unk>
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> menus in <unk> to understand the basic idea of websites or the paper.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> the shape of the flame -- but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they think many more characters.
One person.
If anybody walks back, that's <unk>
As the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the <unk> horizon.
A door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had somebody at home?
This person is getting hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three of them together, get care is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun along the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese Chinese <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to come out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and <unk> Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
And he gave him a good excuse to wear a bright dress and take a magic wand to me.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial <unk> of child <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took over 40 years later to with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy, and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dresses like the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician gets done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
You use magical shoes to defeat the armies as a computer of <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did my daughter, <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
Of only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of <unk> had <unk>  So she was slid in the room and was struck as a mother's mom, behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense of Luke one to <unk> the government?
I put this with the magician <unk>
How do it win Dorothy his film?
And doing good <unk> with each and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much lower capital force in the movies for our children, and so little from the <unk> <unk>
There are a lot of literature on the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served in order to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss I was actually hoping that the credits were going to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a kid, you have to be an <unk> and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend Disney Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, kids, not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movie.
Of course, the most successful issue of course continues to appear in classic after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are earning a child.
As many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no of these films the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do, in the movie, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to turn the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy that we <unk>  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things else.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> film.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus of what is a Hollywood <unk>
<unk> does not happen.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of film happens in a embassy -- where men and women hide during the crisis of <unk>
We have lots of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the most popular films, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a bigger number that this one is going to take you this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually <unk> once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids have something to do with that.
I also don't think music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there is a huge amount of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> with violence and then charge reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to do as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly about parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite <unk> character -- you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and fight more stories where he looked at work is to join a team together, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, to help other people better and be better people.
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I thought I was most like to look for beds of the coast of Maine because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
You're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I would see with my own eyes was not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
I had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the eye, it seems to be brown -- but when we use the infrared and process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes in the landscape of construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find a <unk> old city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there were this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge range of <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll find it random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we used data from NASA to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we thought it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs -- they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the <unk> shots of ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation looking for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick <unk> <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what it shows you there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the <unk> of the Middle Empire these are the stones that <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we <unk> the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- probably written in <unk> four years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
Do ideas really happen in 1984 <unk> B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to just close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now I <unk> a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are racing on a race <unk> race and go in direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They are <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of your home.
There is <unk> flying everywhere, wheels that goes on their side, <unk> of the wheels that ends up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door.
We <unk> into the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
<unk> on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue fur, making it on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can pass it down to the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
Already in the room, and making the maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing about her <unk> <unk> singing <unk> One was <unk> One was <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a path of yellow bricks and from the oven coming towards you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len from "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar <unk> which is happening every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a couple of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- just looking at them once.
It was going to be the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be such a nature of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the most <unk> memories.
I asked him, "You know, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques using ancient techniques in Greece, in the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant <unk> although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What?"
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what our memory is that we are who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper <unk> paper <unk>
We went a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, he was a number of treaties on memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it might seem like today.
So a long time ago, people were investing in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
We've changed the <unk> and I would say that we have changed as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems to be that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of <unk> memory, <unk> and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of University College in London invited a bunch of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains somehow, or structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the ones of control with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as we <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to each other.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is driving as a race race in which each year shows someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of playing <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that used to the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his name.
And then I'm asking you, you know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
You know what <unk>
The person who told them that their name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the <unk> <unk> doesn't really mean nothing to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk> in your hands.
They worked well when they come home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired such as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, he was not brought to a <unk> <unk> a poet.
He stood up, <unk> her memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the classroom of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who there was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> he was standing out of standing in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting every way I was sitting there.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that no matter if we're not good at remembering names, or phone numbers or instructions word for our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If you let me tell me that I was telling the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> it's very likely to make them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask you to say who was sitting on the horse <unk> brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember, the crazy crazy idea, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties on memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that I would have done it <unk> if you were invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering his house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce his friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote who wants to tell.
And then you fly in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for word, which is going to confuse but typical per typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in your memory <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got off filled with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> of competitive.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all <unk> before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Probably a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, I think <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team, for memory.
This is a couple of <unk> and a <unk> covered with tape.
And I ended up back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build memory <unk> or memorize <unk> <unk> to profit with a little bit of insight, about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We <unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It <unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory skills in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm a <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony I gave to the living room.
And there everybody spent the time watching TV. So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone was seeing me, and every time I <unk> and I was involved in a paper -- I was going to be involved in a <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and I hated it.
It was <unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and it's not about a <unk> not of <unk> but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we want.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they <unk> you think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about based on a building built two and a half thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it's a lot of time and it's too complicated.
People who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they want to use ways that you know are going to work.
That's why we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> has this round thing -- has this round thing, <unk> Red brick -- that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the <unk> the <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life forms today.
We gave them the <unk> we gave them so much, that we move away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you believe we feel very well, but we're dead in because we have no choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we are all happy, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> we do swing the back behind and go over and over and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I was <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That's what you can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Very hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We took <unk> and we turned them into <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers. We moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> <unk> now we have new design techniques on a computer, and we found with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when Bilbao and public critical and public critical and public critical people were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> is building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in two and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Seattle, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes they meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the top mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials happened with other <unk>
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with the whole architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how to use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings before I know whether which I designed four years was a success or not.
Because there's never good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years ago, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the media to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's going to be in both extremes -- almost in <unk> and <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the <unk>
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York State.
It's a <unk>
But that meant that two years before the building would end the building, it was already part of the community, and like drawings look exactly like the product finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, and it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one did the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes you <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media is not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building would build us today, the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded by bombarded with <unk> of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
And architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings and <unk> and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't embrace something that I haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave them by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, of a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick -- based on ideas of what you should be at the <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we ultimately will be ready for the ways that are going to make.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can be <unk> in the East <unk> New York City of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we built is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent, smarter buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite place.
Find an architect, <unk> and working together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces -- local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he already started walking.
And it does this very typical way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that the most likes to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
So apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when's a couple of this?
How is we suddenly not taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
He's got a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And between what his mom tells him and what his friends or friends of school are told, you don't know who believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he says to others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even deserve to think of them.
We talk about a <unk> ordinary teenager who receives these answers to one of the most vulnerable life stages of their lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, and so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures on the hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- is <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of saying they have and the kinds of comments that are <unk>
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what's <unk> <unk>
What is the most <unk> in somebody's life in front of someone in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are cover in the age of now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> <unk> and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of every other aspect of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and their studies are starting to be hurt.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they're not nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and the working field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you look good, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently <unk> <unk> a smaller note to the average of your companions who don't care about that <unk>
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it goes apart from what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be right, we are talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The low self-esteem of its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> healthcare.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, in more diet -- not healthy than you can take to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's why it's all about what makes more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet -- <unk> <unk> <unk> sexual <unk> and without protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs about billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think you're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or no greater <unk> rates.
Eighty percent of women are not presented with a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to develop the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really struck by when I learned that a lot of good <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follows our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, the first is the influence of the family, friends and relationships.
These six kinds of ways are starting to be critical for anyone willing to provide an education in your body self-esteem that works.
One education is a <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take care of each of us who take <unk> in the question, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
We challenge the current status of how women are seen and talked in our circles.
It's not good to have the input of our politicians in <unk> <unk> or the size of its <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start making responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When did the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as well as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their entire person, to respect to individuality, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
For making a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two degrees away. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he <unk> him for no longer having a long legs, <unk> more <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and <unk> that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are holding back to all.
But let our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just one part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them, for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
I survived self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year age in the age of today, they become agents for themselves safe tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the fifth of November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
At early initially they were initially naive, but being prisoner by the other <unk> in the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 <unk> from New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans was being held by an FBI informant by the FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer with an engineer with an American mother, an American school teacher from the two did all of the possible childhood childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam -- that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people that are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks we have to use all the possible media for everybody living as them.
A few months before his arrest he sat up with me and explained that in the last few weekends he and some friends had been going to <unk> in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained to me how to point to the goal about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot him at the little orange light on the goal and for surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Like a parent, such child.
All right, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they found so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the north parking park in the North Trade Center, and causing a <unk> that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times -- that instability during my childhood not allowed me to do a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was time to pack and go to another city.
Because I was always the new face of the class as often as I was <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the <unk> quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't have social skills, to say to <unk> <unk> and I was not prepared for the real world.
I was raised "Yes, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I test to the test is that I think, was during the presidential election in 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence as I had been the victim of <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the guys who we had ever asked friendship, was dangerous.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to defeat the barrier that all life had been done to believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found them with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned out to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay players there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics than I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had been taught by the experience of the interaction of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is <unk> but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night. Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a time when I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that I keep my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eye of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative the negative energy needs to keep all that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and started a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself into a <unk>
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who you're trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that although I gave myself this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism and talking, against those <unk> acts, as rejection to my father's actions.
And with this <unk> I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or a race, which children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's a <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your <unk> your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of childhood moments that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a <unk> voice in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the head of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing to make you more directly.
At least I know I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certain you are conscious.
<unk> is also the reason for living.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just <unk> robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective to us.
<unk> by nature, is subjective things.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
Now, psychology studied <unk> behavior, <unk> the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feel pain or feel happy or feeling a happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations here.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers some questions that we want you to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is this a internal movie.
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emergent phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate <unk> how are <unk> how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> living organisms -- they're all questions about how we target it.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we figure out how we are talking about, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating his head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk>
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- we got used to make this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know how.
So with an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were <unk> mad, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain brain functions, the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to listen to it.
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time I have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing else.
Instead, they are considered fundamental principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, <unk> <unk> law, and he applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, dough -- load, then by logic -- there is a <unk>
The more natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the <unk> the mass, the physical process.
Now physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think "Oh, "Oh, I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is, perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anybody think something so crazy?
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time, and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful shape of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing information, there's <unk>
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years I was a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there's a level of information integration of information, as a lot of significant consciousness -- pretty important awareness.
But when you get to <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness.
In fact, a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the underlying reality behind us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that makes fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can be very serious social and moral consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you embrace that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that it tends to transform your dreams, while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problem -- really serious ethical problems about the ethic of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the general collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level of the local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk -- at this point, we have a TED conscience  A Hollywood movie for this whole group of TED, different from the movies in every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a serious consciousness theory.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait at solving the night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village of Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a <unk> profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She didn't actually get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> profile on my mother's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the series of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the middle class of studies -- a kid raised her hand and said, "Hey, when do you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about law enforcement for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people were chairs and they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability with disabled objects.
And they weren't -- and it's not fault by the boy, namely, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for them to tell you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to us about disability.
Yes, they've been sold the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without a pencil with a pencil holding out of the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running out of carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn term -- because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we have the disabled disabled of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that it's my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of the number of times I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen to before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was standing up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images with disability on the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
Let's take a few things.
But the things that we don't have -- aren't the things that you can think of.
They are not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability to do, and that's what happens with kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by <unk>
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I didn't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your mobile phone battery in your battery battery battery battery battery battery battery <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that you've been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stick stick hasn't done a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't consider no <unk> nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to get up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about it, I know what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and private football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think in "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality, because augmented reality, changing our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing -- Google Glass.
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running from the game camp to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> trying to stick it with all of your being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you, what is to use the Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine coming up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
It's a little bit a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You might have noticed that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> it can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many already knows about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why does this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! Don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running down the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the <unk> or you would take a <unk> <unk>
What will be your experience when you take a mountain over to over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the diapers <unk> sales <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want them because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties for you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being alone.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
He <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> a open <unk> All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the system of <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> will tell you there's a open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight a grass area that lights up and you can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public is <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to do lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how people live <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual of us.
Thank you.
I recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years gave me the <unk> the south end of the <unk> County, which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> <unk> Gate was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, as the each one of him releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of us die in the impact.
The ones that not, normally they <unk> in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of the suicide <unk> will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is at the edge, and in its <unk> it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you about joy that we had successful that day to bring him back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those to <unk> suicide, but government officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, <unk> veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this at July 22 last year by getting a call from a <unk> subject sitting at the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I noticed Jason speaking with a official <unk> <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old and he had flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown down here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came up with <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of kind <unk> guy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the <unk> rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been <unk>
<unk> eat <unk> affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you do?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how you feel it, because you probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> yourself in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost her son on the 19th of January, and he wrote this email about a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I think you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the game of 49 <unk> her father on the 19th of January.
It never got there.
And I called the police officer and <unk> it as disappeared as <unk>
The next morning, two officers came to my home and told me that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness I had seen from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering from real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor not cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way her son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied to a radio call by a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk north.
I <unk> my poster on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next time, I heard about as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to come back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> it <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did to <unk> and gave the hope and life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "You know.
You let me talk and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the events at 11 March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> up with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she write, <unk> When I visited General <unk> Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I thought I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with poison.
That act, in spite of the end of his own pain, the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think about people who think about hurt someone else.
They just want their own pain away.
Usually this is achieved just three things: sleep, drug or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and have been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved with -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand in three times.
At the end of the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Moreover, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they end the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be <unk> to do.
<unk> you can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you focus on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in this way.
When I became a model I felt that I had achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My exterior would finally get into my inner truth, with my inner truth.
So for reasons that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of that skin and the beliefs of those are around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this <unk> is called the <unk>
This is mine.
It recorded me as <unk> when I was born because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you wearing that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never taught myself to share my story, not because he thought to be what I'm bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have <unk> Dad and a family who took me like I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman first came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you ever involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if he <unk> she went over the <unk> <unk> and <unk> And that night, he won in the bathroom, he won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 years?
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was <unk> of beauty of <unk> but I did.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when I went back to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, all of that, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my application on the green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you <unk> the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary before we change their name before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving driver's name, and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity paper means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City that <unk> was living his truth, but that, <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All last 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer has no more <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
to my network of support my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young people who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take the phone, I would take my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just identity <unk> that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to be born, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table with the topic that sometimes that <unk> not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity and ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In many tribal and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when I was born a child, her birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome, no for his father, no for her mother.
<unk> comes back to the mother, and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of fun for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, they <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, you feel guilty like a criminal.
Not just the <unk> but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it grows, it feels too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and school to her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years in a way, he has a good life.
You can <unk>
She can play with your friends in the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when I <unk> 13 years old, you have to have come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called his name for her father and her brothers and her family, and if you <unk> the code of that honor and honor it might even kill it.
And it's interesting that this basic honor of honor, not only affects life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members in the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm of the <unk> societies that's called <unk>
It's not supposed to be a very good girl and very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and embracing the decisions of their father and mother and decisions in the elderly even if they don't will.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man, you have to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If you get very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of her children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I <unk> it in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, is a great event for life of a child.
<unk> in a school means speech recognition and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where its potential to explore its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and I was in the relative part of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why they value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends were coming to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to put them on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
I taught my daughters, teaching students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and raised on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, the BBC, was offered to the New York Times documentaries and I spoke in every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate her campaign and the October nine of 2012, was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read her back to my <unk> "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, and because of the <unk> and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were a lot of <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask back again.
When I <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe headaches and severe headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to go, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when you don't have this task.
They fight with her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google <unk> group, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before joining Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a <unk>
You're still like smart or not?
If you're not like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide to decide about the combinations of <unk> and mix them together to keep life.
More than once I've saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the <unk> <unk> because there is no of a clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to test with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the <unk> dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I made an classic chemical dose for a man of <unk> and I was surprised by looking at how my thinking <unk>
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  --  of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> <unk>
It turned out to be an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just wasn't going on like that.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to do -- I've been better at men.
What I was trying to do about how to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to regain my intelligence after disease, and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> think almost always in images, and that became my key <unk> and how to get those of those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
These kinds of thoughts are not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things differently.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today we have the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right -- and I have already lots of great mental <unk> mental <unk> and very well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director could be able to use your imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two major groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an MRI MRI scan to represent the brain -- here you can see the brain scan by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
And the column of the environment, shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the waves into the visual fields.
Let's go this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a big package of reactions in the brain in front of video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as they were <unk> a new <unk>
So the computer is using just the brain brain information to show you what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that you showed you.
This blew us out.
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> brain systems available today, and their resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do this?
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give that one.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- we must first ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way of getting bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, <unk> magnets only offered little improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands as we need to.
I propose this idea: rather large magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with arrangements and slightly different <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI is to make really large magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> pair of FM radio <unk>
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, they include magnetic patterns, structured magnetic patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with patterns of <unk> radio <unk> we can increase <unk> information that can be extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of blood -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity directly. This is the dream.
We are able to <unk> our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the <unk> of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few options more than to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
She's probably saying to some person for the first time he loves it, or tell someone who you're pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever <unk> in life.
<unk> is a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have been out of that closet that's universal.
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of the South Side of a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> led to <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> of my <unk> and I would have <unk> my head -- I was a little bit, I asked you usually a child -- "Hey, "Hey, you're a <unk>
And he would appear to appear on the table.
I <unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold, look at her son.
But I would never say anything and <unk> up inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
<unk> familiar, but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues at the table   I had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," the <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I went down and I went down and I went down to my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
So I took a deeper breath, and I got a little bit <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is somewhat <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see a boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
Now, I'm more than a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. It's just <unk>
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest place I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color walls.
You just know how a feels living in a closet.
That's how my <unk> is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you a hundred reasons why you get out of my closet -- it was harder to come out of his, but here's the thing: The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared on bank <unk> is harder to tell him that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to tell your child five years you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is hard for us to do with respect to another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our <unk> and we should only feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make it feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a closet that's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> <unk>
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years who would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen in the fear, <unk> in one corner of my <unk> dark <unk> my <unk> <unk> and the moving only muscle is the scariest thing I ever ever ever could.
My family, my friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world was turned around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so much time, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew she was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally I came to one where my friends were my parents, people who knew me years old.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your TV show.
Our program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting for desperately his support, to get me to know that I was from my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is a <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at the time, as you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
That's how the hard conversations are still without being my strong.
Ask anybody who I have ever <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any <unk> is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee, I had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know we can do it.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be touched by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that thing in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen as an example as an example has been the famous example of <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so some years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about Earth's biology or the Earth of Earth no matter of the Earth, but have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives and see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know about it, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth's intelligence -- you would see how to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at some point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of an <unk> planet stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical physics of intelligence.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, to the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in heart movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different and <unk> and <unk> together, asking for a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There is only one equation.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is an claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize future freedom of action, or keeping open choices with a force in T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, to an impending future time.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like it to be <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping open options.
And so in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with entropy production, in the long term, but actually emerges from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system that will be found inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play games, and even making money -- <unk> actions, all of it without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance it will have applications for <unk> robotics and human <unk>
This ability to use applications of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> and it stays with success the <unk>
This same capacity of network network also has applications in health care, and in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand its scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> has widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of action negotiation -- successfully increase assets under their management management.
This ability to risk management will have vast applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one single equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> <unk> was always the concept that if you were using smart machines there would be a <unk> rebellion, in it.
Machines would be <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
I often ask me, how do you look for targets and learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move the descendants to help them build artificial artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be view as a physical process that is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we have greatly <unk> our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light to get us.
<unk> collected data gathered the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets of the solar system, and also the amount of light that receiving their <unk>
Instead, it gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since the years now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know about, our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world to prove this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface in search of the origins of life as we know it.
So the satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also <unk> possibility to live on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> a big and sad <unk> and the implication of some that Mars will wait to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
So for a lot that I like exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is how you imagine that the captain of the Titanic would tell you that the party of Titanic will be place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for urban exploration, and the Earth's preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of <unk> preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
You only find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist, Enrico Fermi asked us to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a potential solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to the way to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the planets that are <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> and space exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to apply to the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where I had them <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and they were all very <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because he had a flight early to Europe in the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was pretty close to.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate, <unk> the adrenaline levels, and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which was <unk> that was bad things.
Or at least if the bad things happen, if things happen, the probability of it is a total <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later my thoughts are not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him about it <unk> the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared shared my <unk> something called <unk> retrospective with me.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years ago, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you try to figure out all the things that could be wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, they <unk> a place for things that really lose easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of important things, where the fish are right, where the fish are -- that places the fish are <unk> where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
<unk> a particular drawer for it.
For your reading <unk> a particular <unk>
If you pick up a place and they're <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a cell phone photo a picture of your credit cards, license card, <unk> <unk> by mail itself in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or your wish to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for every single decision of medical choices, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take from what would benefit an assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack the heart of the brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've already heard about <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even more likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that most of the doctors don't want to talk about, and drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> number it needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having surgery in any medical procedure before they help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not fault with the doctor, and if it's someone <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs are just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to research research research -- <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think of clarity.
So think about how you <unk> this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you the drug to help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> ethic is a part of the informed consent set.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number that you need to treat is pretty typical.
To the surgery that is done in the older men of the 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for one person who has helped.
And the side effects on that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can actually make the conversation go forward.
You don't have to make this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 to face with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get to lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situation.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize harm or to prevent things wrong with the first place.
You walk into the snow of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor gave me a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of the gate in the same way an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't ordered -- and lots of messages I haven't read for you.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree, and you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- never <unk> a whole silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came over the decade in the 1800s, and over the time it was mixed with local <unk> and developed the language we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, living in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and norms.
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
<unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato chips.
"I don't <unk> and when you're eating, Make sure you have <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than what the average person does it.
I'm <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I can do that with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to say more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all they had taught me as the sound of sound, and I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented him to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and the amount of attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- <unk> social currency.
In my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could <unk>
I chose to <unk> me.
There's a massive culture around the speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from just as well as and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If you don't continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and completely express on paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect everything as much of signs as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the speed of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, as you touches the piano, English is a linear language, as if you <unk> just an <unk> at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one <unk> it would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> using these different <unk> <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk>
This is the signal <unk>
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and I put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For instance, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day day.
I feel that the same thing can be said by <unk> <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night in this draw.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how the body to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to take a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through my head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of your hands in high school.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head as a <unk> something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, third. Please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job. <unk>
Look at how the three signs are very similar -- everything happens in your head and my chest -- but they transmit very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> don't automatically have social value.
We need to start questioning what makes social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not to hear music to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination was carrying all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up at a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up others.
Time spent now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in the Hong Kong of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach to walk around with lots of trash.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if they are, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But hard for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making up a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> labor <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate power tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids get very excited with the robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we can transform light bulbs and turn it into accessories.
We see the pieces of plastic floating around, slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors to call <unk> with the hope that someone would have it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to fix them right now.
But my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, you see the Internet, and they get <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years -- cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink, it's the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live in.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also brown color and when it all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help you identify what's in the water.
We looked at this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> <unk> in the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and the majority of the time, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and <unk> independently with other scientists, the land, the river -- and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course I don't <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we informed the center of <unk> here you see using different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them with them, we discussed the data, and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And this is what we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> and <unk> system.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an Civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishing aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the larger space of the social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become a reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels chairs in new vehicles.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, <unk> <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned with the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel -- the other one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One imposes on the environment, the other thing I thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts primarily as <unk> the other thing as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that shapes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the growth, between Henry Ford and growth, among Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere -- and we can imagine, it shows you on the two screens behind me.
My job on their simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and coming to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands in my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scale, such as this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base, which one day not very far to print <unk> buildings made of genetically engineered buildings that glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> an archetype of the former Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each <unk> is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion <unk> <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Along with a <unk> 3D <unk> we print this layer and 3D skirt without <unk> between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
So designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a <unk> chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable <unk> and also absorbs sound.
Professor Carter is <unk> we went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> surface it becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not by addition to other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a Jewish Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made it growing trees with <unk> cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if the objects were made of a single <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material, the kind of tree <unk> material with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year of shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune on their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We <unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft, transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single material that was <unk> feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you let it dry and find a natural way of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet does <unk> billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed to genetically capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> to mesh, and if it grows even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed in the ground, will grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> <unk>
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human body.
It turns out the light to sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the tract <unk> that will help you flow these bacteria and to <unk> their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
And if we wanted more photosynthesis, it <unk> more transparent.
This <unk> system <unk> when you stretch from one end to the other, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our small intestine as well.
And here it is, as I <unk> our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life within your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very early creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design is <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology material.
To do that, we always need to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer <unk> material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do it like that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, attached those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates an <unk> structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you <unk> a <unk> and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that shape -- the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
You often get rid of the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we picked this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot called <unk> of silk, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms would go into darker and <unk> and cool areas of that we use a solar chart to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- distributes the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We were asking for <unk> of silk to a toy farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to engage with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much <unk>
Buckminster Fuller said that the tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on the <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in just more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full empty <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a inspired design of nature to a nature inspired by the first time, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make ourselves in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time they asked them.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. <unk> Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and <unk> websites -- I was playing the guitar in a punk band named <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist in anyway, for having dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of, this feeling of, this feeling -- this is no longer the challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to let it up.
But then I'm going to ask me about something else, something completely different, and I would get involved in it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern became a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason for me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to ask me back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you <unk> it in the learned of culture.
We ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question we get over and over again as we grow up in various ways, <unk> students are asked to be going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the beautiful exercise of before it takes away the dream.
Why?
If this is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, it's not inspires to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the contrary, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though well-intentioned adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> <unk> editor at <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear people talking about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be in your time on this land, and you have to figure out what's that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that show me and a lot of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so to say.
It could help if you divide up in three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
And during the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: The synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and I travel, mathematics and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
It comes up with new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is hard learning.
When we were <unk> we are going to do that.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start out of zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk> we know.
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was a lot of financial <unk>
It had to learn the simplest sales mechanics when they was starting their practices and this ability to write a compelling time for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to do what you're going to do, even if you finally read it.
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field of a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other designer designer pages, sometimes a paper translation of Kickstarter, sometimes a <unk> and sometimes, it seems like James <unk>
It's valuable because it's a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine, defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, rapid learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> out of the belly knowing what they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams have a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, he can dive deep and put ideas into ideas, and <unk> offers a <unk> of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and racing lives with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to <unk> in a large part of them are encouraging them to simply be more like their <unk> <unk>
And once I said that, if there's one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep their curiosity for those <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, he died in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you <unk> I had been living today, we couldn't give her more help than he was <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has been very high at all.
There have been antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually it has made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's ever for a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that your years goes through Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or being wanted with Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spending in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its <unk> <unk> increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than from other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, everybody, even scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy adult brain compared to the patient's Alzheimer's to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy and it's always <unk>
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places on paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of which block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make it explode.
You have to find the right step that you can do, and then create a drug that is done.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick in each other inside them, as in human Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at the early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this is that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware of Alzheimer's disease is a disease that if we <unk> it we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the singing victims of their loved day, day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
I want to talk about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article on the column -- <unk> <unk> from the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love to do this.
The article is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience I would try to test it at last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number four: If you could wake tomorrow with one quality or a skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you're going to put another person?
And <unk>
You <unk> these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me, <unk> your partner what you like to do, or it -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled upon this study a few years ago, a really really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send the <unk>
That was printed in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourself, they follow <unk>
And the reason I think we challenge this is because I have done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I thought my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousands of <unk>
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as a result, I had no idea.
The article was published in line on Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, already had called the Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article was getting over eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing honestly about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that loving life has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: they still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages just appear immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I think this is a part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should wait for people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times was published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers by testing the study in them with different amounts of success.
So my first impulse to all of this is to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every request for both of us to make a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and he refused to ask for pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> a range for the one that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really wanted to know if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but a real, real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to answer.
My relationship was just about a few months, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if they were doing together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for <unk> <unk> between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer to doing a number more studies, and also used <unk> protocol, as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the members of the police and the community -- and they used it among people of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact -- was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
I said, "You want to tell you that you would tell you about the person who you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, "But it became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to get better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled upon the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to practically my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or whether or if I could live without it.
So I took to the science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could kind of change the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I would just work for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I built up with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what it looks after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much as the reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for love is an idiot, not just being a little bit <unk> and being <unk> but to keep being <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that the question is, still together?
And his content with a <unk> response, or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's ask us to ask more difficult questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation, about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's a <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we're still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy thing.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think so many times we would have to make that decision, and how many times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before I would always choose or not.
I want it to be done enough to have done and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest American daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe of.
And what I <unk> and what maybe I spend my life looking for is that this myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't invent it.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also will love me, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian in full mountain, and in some ways I came like a <unk> of the forest.
The city in New York ago, a long time ago,  -- which really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the <unk> of strange or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going from tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered the covered of resin and a bee kept <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened, in some way it appeared that it takes up size, as if you were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add elements that were strange and odd bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for all of my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can be able to draw in space.
Can I flow out, draw the same as a <unk> <unk>
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals ...
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did a few insects and weird creatures.
It was very much fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of <unk> <unk> with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window away, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of form.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> meters long.
It's double expensive, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're going from the <unk> to this <unk> <unk> mesh where they <unk>
This is where <unk> creatures are run by <unk> lists for <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
<unk> also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a <unk> <unk> and spits out <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail set up to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made out of <unk> terrorist cards.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards in the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of us is a archive of our culture, through media and material and <unk> or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive of a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they get together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I am getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's his chest, you can break the door.
I'm going to have the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is that has a kind of thing to do.
It's a quick refresher for these works because I can't run it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a <unk> <unk> a museum -- a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world.
It <unk> the box and all the people in <unk> each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have the effect of pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
Being a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their <unk> side effects on its negative side, because in the time that it takes to get to the current current -- and it was <unk> and worse than the time it takes to get to your fate, which is where it's more important, in the <unk>
These are regions of the body as the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood <unk> of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral therapy.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new <unk> cells.
This is the big issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment of life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "We will make the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific champion in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it to <unk> for wounds and surgery <unk> they can be used for anything else -- including transportation drug transportation.
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open or drill a extremely small <unk> which opens and shut down, almost immediately cells with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people ask yourself, "How do that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam over the cell cell cell infected while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> or <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How do that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the location of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, goes to the location of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that <unk> the pill releases it directly at the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups of armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shooting it.
My goal is to understand better to these domestic agents of violence and studying ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For instance, of the <unk> peace agreements, between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had been signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
That's why we have to understand these <unk> we even need to <unk> or <unk> in any successful successful resolution process.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and policy policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, we also have established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Gaza Bank, since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking themselves.
It <unk> a complex communication machine, stations, TV channels, web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through <unk> business companies for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population to invest in social services.
They build schools, you run hospitals, run for professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghan Afghanistan was <unk> by the war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> it can be understood also looking at the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, to provide social services that means to fill in a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to build and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of <unk> Palestinian cannot understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid <unk>
<unk> because they were doing <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, less can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, and they run all of their <unk> collect the trash, and you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of <unk> nations, and the more weak nations are states, as in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military <unk>
<unk> that government <unk> has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and we put peace to peace.
If we understand the <unk> <unk> we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors that are not <unk> military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety gap.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or <unk>
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music by volume.
Although the letter degrades to women and offends me the classic <unk> classic of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely influenced by my musical tragedy.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects -- the collection of the grass and maintaining the maintenance of it.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of <unk> fairy tales, you make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it is her choice, and I'm not who you want to release.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, <unk> that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, and gay workers and <unk> for women and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist issue.
It also happens by this: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we <unk> <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think about that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what that call -- for fear of not being able to be able to achieve the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star embrace openly feminism and do the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics start a whole debates as much as <unk> or not quite a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go far beyond <unk> and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it doesn't get anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> <unk> or more good, an <unk> is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier than you would be happier than providing a limitless.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions spill this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve to do, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old <unk>
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want them to grow in a world.
And they were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports -- where athletes treat their partners as <unk> <unk>
In any case, the men, especially the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish her magazine participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't have enough number of women, so much to participate in order to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage us to be even more like us, to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power of directors and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> people who can take a huge durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to do with courage -- bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because the ancient voice was stolen from me, and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few boys were passionate about when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I did not tell me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and <unk> I also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us, is nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I submit the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm a good woman, I am trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas year, <unk> children in California had measles to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the measles that may be lousy for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily dramatic diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> <unk> hadn't been <unk> because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> and <unk> and <unk> by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
They don't believe most intelligent scientists that theory cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will invest in danger to their children from autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare.
The few psychologists and whoever had heard that I had heard about her creating their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence went stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the <unk> of Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman looking for the face of her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> in science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on the global public health world.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> worlds private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun during hours by waving their hands to their faces, but they were <unk> <unk> like when they weren't put their favorite toy in their usual room without knowing them.
On the basis of the <unk> patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared I'd seen less than 150 cases of its syndrome while <unk> references from places as far from South Africa.
This is actually no secret, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis for children with <unk> but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had a <unk> that he had turned to nine percent every 10 children sent out by other doctors to their office.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents.
These children, said, they have kept very carefully in a fridge not <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite <unk> he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard their parents are desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own right, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand to the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find the child kids in the community.
What you saw is that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful paintings and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one had noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document gives an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a spent school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and the children kept their games on Saturday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, <unk> described as <unk> <unk> of life that required <unk> spaces and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, as they called their little teachers, and they went to help in the development of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> recently saw autism as a continuous continuum that included an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> in the known culture of pop culture and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with that autism was <unk> as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that we <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes enter into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wider and <unk> model.
These changes don't have broken <unk>
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult adult in the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> for experts knew what was autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four <unk> <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents all over the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, we were introduced to the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact waiting for them to be out of autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a powerful, powerful story -- a credible story as a theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of the prevention of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that puzzles are to solve for new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and he suffers from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> people are autistic people to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in cover to <unk> the boat <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
